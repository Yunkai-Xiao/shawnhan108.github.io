Hello, 

This is the repository to my personal website: https://shawnhan108.github.io

When making this website I utilized bootstrap 4 with HTML, CSS and some javascript. The php email handler file is not being used due to the fact that github pages can only handle static sites. Instead, I am using Formspree as a server to send (forward) emails.

I also used animate.css for text animations. 

Feel free to leave a comment under the contact tab. Thank you.
